I hope this message finds you well. We need to finalize the Q2 budget allocations before the board meeting next Tuesday.

The Finance team has prepared preliminary numbers, but we need departmental leads to review and approve their respective allocations.

Key deadlines:
- Q2 Budget draft: Friday EOD
- Final review: Monday morning
- Board presentation: Tuesday 10am

Could you please review the attached spreadsheet and confirm your team's numbers by Friday?

Best regards,
Sarah`,

We have multiple clients requesting OAuth support (Google, GitHub, Microsoft). This would significantly improve our adoption and reduce friction for enterprise customers.

From our sales pipeline, I'd estimate we could close 3-4 deals if we had this feature within 6 weeks.

Could you scope this out and provide an estimate? Would also help if we could get this on the roadmap ASAP.

Thanks!

Good timing - we were already scoping OAuth. I think we can realistically deliver Google + GitHub in 3-4 weeks if we prioritize it.

Let me pull together a more detailed estimate and we can discuss in our next sync.

Reviewed the proposal - looks solid! A few minor notes:

1. Timeline on page 3 could use more detail on Phase 2
2. Consider adding case study reference on page 7
3. Pricing is competitive

These are minor tweaks. Overall, I think we're ready to present to the client.
